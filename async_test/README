Simple example of async usage.

~ Use build_echo.sh to build an echo server

  - echo_server.native 
     * server : receive connection and resend what it receives

  - echo_client.native 
     * client connect to server and send 1000 string with random length

  - echo_merge.native 
     * runs both the server and client

~ Use build_rpc.sh to build an example using Rpc library

  - rpc_server.native
     * runs a server who implements a set of rpc

  - rpc_client.native
     * runs a client that query the server
